# Praetorian Challenges
Repository to house code/documentation for Praetorian technical challenges (https://www.praetorian.com/challenges/)

## Crypto Challenges
The solutions for the crypto challenges are held in the Crypto dir. To access Praetorian's Crypto API and solve challenges, run `Crypto.py` held in the Crypto directory.

Challenge 3 currently uses the Python module `pillow`. To run Crypto.py, be sure to install this module with the following command:

```
sudo apt install python3-pillow
```
